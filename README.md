    - name 
    - author 
    - user_rating 
    - number_of_reviews 
    - price 
    - year 
    - genre 

#### creation_of_book_list()
- ***(done)*** (5 points): As a data analyst, I want to instantiate a Book object for each dictionary within the “data_list” list and add the Book instantiation to a “books” list variable.  

- ***(done)*** (5 points): As a data analyst, I want to print a message to the terminal above each evaluation question’s result explaining the original evaluation question and my findings.  

#### q1: book_most_appeared()
- ***(done)*** (5 points): As a data analyst, I want to determine what book has been in the top 50s list for the most years and print the book’s title and the number of times it has appeared in the list to the terminal. 

#### q2 -> genre_most_appeared()
- ***(done)*** (5 points): As a data analyst, I want to determine which genre (fiction/non-fiction) has appeared the most in the top 50s list and print the result to the terminal. 

#### q3 -> author_with_most_distinct()
